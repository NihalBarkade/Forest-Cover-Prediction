# üå≤ Forest Cover Type Prediction

This project is a machine learning application that predicts the forest cover type from cartographic variables. It uses a trained model and a Streamlit web app to make predictions based on user input.

## üöÄ Features

- Predicts forest cover type using 54 features including topographical and soil data.
- Interactive Streamlit web interface.
- Trained using a high-accuracy machine learning model.
- Ready for deployment on Streamlit Cloud.
